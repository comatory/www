I am a software developer based in Czech Republic with emphasis on front-end & UI development.

I create web and mobile applications that are easy to maintain, deploy and test.

I enjoy creating products from the ground up and making them a reality. Working on platform side of things with emphasis on developer experience is something that's close to me as well.

I have worked in early stage startups, scale-up startups and mid-size companies.
